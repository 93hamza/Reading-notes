Who is the Site For It? can be helpful to ask some
questions about the people you
would expect to be interested in
the subject of your site
Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users.
To help determine why people
are coming to your website,
there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask
First you want to create a list
of reasons why people would
be coming to your site. You can
then assign the list of tasks to
the fictional visitors you created
in the step described on the

Information
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.
header footer
The nav element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.
The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
The aside element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an article
element or not.
The section element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading
The purpose of the hgroup
element is to group together a
set of one or more h1 through
h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.
You already met the figure
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images). 
However, the div element
will remain an important way to
group together related elements,
because you should not be using
these new elements that you
have just met for purposes other
than those explicitly stated
If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:

Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page â€” and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
The meta element lives
inside the head element and
contains information about that
web page.
