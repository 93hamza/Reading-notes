How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic

Every input or output Is a type of information by on or of 1or 0 
Computer uses millions electronic component which come together to be form circuits
If you give the circuits 1 will give you 0 and if you give it 0 it will give you 1
A complicated circuit take multiple signals & combine them to give different result 
Logic gates 
Or 
And 
Not
You can make a circuit add together called adder to calculate the sum 
And there is subtraction and multiplication 
Modern circuits can performance billions of calculations per second

How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output

All computer does the same 4 things 
Input from outside the world
Store information
Process CPU central processing calculation information 
Output converts info to physical output
Each of these things are connected with each other
Example b converted to number 1 or 0 and understand pixel by pixel and send it to screen 
So to display each letter a computer runs a thousand of instruction  
Types of output 
Speaker 
Printer 
Motor of car and so on 

How Computers Work: Hardware and Software

Hardware: chips circuits stuff plugs wires speaker 
Software code website web application 
But how it works together 
By SPU master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
It has circuits 
Which to use and when to use 
Binary code 
Today we have paython ruby blockly 
Operating system control other stuff 
Cpu output input memory and switching between them quickly 
Code to bulid the bage
